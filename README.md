# youtube-bb-modified
<font size=8>I made a little change to this code（https://github.com/mbuckler/youtube-bb）.</font>

Changes:

①When a movie can't be downloaded by youtube-dl, it's 'yt_id' will be stored in './error-youtube_dl-yt_id.txt'.

②When a movie can't be parsed by ffmpeg, it's 'yt_id' will be stored in './error-ffmpeg-yt_id.txt'.


Usage：

You only need replace it's 'youtube_bb.py'(https://github.com/mbuckler/youtube-bb/youtube_bb.py) by 'youtube_bb.py' of this repository.

The use-method of code isn't changed anyway.
